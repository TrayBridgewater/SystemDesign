# SystemDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a company that strives to expand access to quality drivers education. They wanted me to design a system that would allow customers to take online and in-person driving lessons. 

What did you do particularly well?
I thought I did well designing the UML charts towards the end of the course. These will allow the software developers to pick up and actually implement the system. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would create more UML charts so that the implementation team has a stronger and more concrete understanding of the system and the various intricacies of its desing.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by carefully studying the transcript of our interview and rooting all of my design decisions in the needs they explicitly laid out. User needs must be considered because they are the cornerstone of the entire system design process. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Software design should be centered around user needs. One should always refer back to the requests of the user and build a system around exactly the problem they are trying to solve. This prevents scope creep and ensures your software is being designed to meet their needs.
